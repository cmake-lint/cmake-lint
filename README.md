cmakelint parses CMake files and reports style issues.

cmakelint requires Python.

## Installation

To install cmakelint from PyPI, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install cmakelint

## Usage

    Syntax: cmakelint [--config=file] [--filter=-x,+y] <file> [file] ...
    filter=-x,+y,...
      Specify a comma separated list of filters to apply

    config=file
      Use the given file for configuration. By default the file
      $PWD/.cmakelintrc, ~/.config/cmakelintrc, $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/cmakelintrc or
      ~/.cmakelintrc is used if it exists. Use the value "None" to use no
      configuration file (./None for a file called literally None) Only the
      option "filter=" is currently supported in this file.

Run the `--filter=` option with no filter to see available options. Currently
these are:

    convention/filename
    linelength
    package/consistency
    package/stdargs
    readability/logic
    readability/mixedcase
    readability/wonkycase
    syntax
    whitespace/eol
    whitespace/extra
    whitespace/indent
    whitespace/mismatch
    whitespace/newline
    whitespace/tabs

An example .cmakelintrc file would be as follows:

    filter=-whitespace/indent

With this file in your home directory, running these commands would have the
same effect:

    cmakelint.py CMakeLists.txt
    cmakelint.py --filter=-whitespace/indent CMakeLists.txt

Filters can optionally be directly enabled/disabled from within a CMake file,
overriding the configuration from file or CLI argument:

```
# lint_cmake: <+ or -><filter name>
# e.g.:
# lint_cmake: -readability/wonkycase
# add multiple filters as list:
# lint_cmake: <+/-><filter1>, <+/-><filter2>
```

cmakelint can also be run with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com). Add the following configuration block to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

``` yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/cmake-lint/cmake-lint
    hooks:
      - id: cmakelint
```

# Output status codes

The program should exit with the following status codes:

* 0 if everything went fine
* 1 if an error message was issued
* 32 on usage error
